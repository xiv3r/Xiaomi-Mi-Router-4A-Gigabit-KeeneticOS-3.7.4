# Xiaomi Mi Router 4A Gigabit KeeneticOS v3.7.4
Install KeeneticOS 3.7.4 Firmware on Xiaomi Router 4A Gigabit Edition


- [Download Here!!!](https://codeload.github.com/xiv3r/Xiaomi-Mi-Router-4A-Gigabit-KeeneticOS-3.7.4/zip/refs/heads/main) the archive with scripts, unpack. There are many files in the folder, we are only interested in `!Start.bat`


- If Breed is already installed, go to step 4

- Reset the router, go through the initial setup and set a password (for further convenience, set 12345678). Disconnect everything unnecessary from the router and from the PC, and also turn off WiFi on the PC. 2. Run !Start.bat and select items from 1 to 4 one by one. The data folder will contain a backup of the current firmware and eeprom. Keep them in a safe place.

- Go to Breed at 192.168.1.1. The downloaded archive contains 3 firmware with different service codes, you can flash any one if you do not plan to combine several routers flashed with one dump into a mesh

- Download the firmware according to the instructions, someone elseâ€™s eeprom with poppies and calibrations is already built into the firmware, you can use it this way, or change the eeprom to yours received in step 2



- Default access 192.168.1.1 login: admin password: 12345678. Wi-Fi: 12345678
